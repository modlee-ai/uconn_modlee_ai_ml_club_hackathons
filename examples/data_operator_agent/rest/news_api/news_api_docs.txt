Documentation
News API is a simple HTTP REST API for searching and retrieving live articles from all over the web. It can help you answer questions like:

What top stories is TechCrunch running right now?
What new articles were published about the next iPhone today?
Has my company or product been mentioned or reviewed by any blogs recently?
You can search for articles with any combination of the following criteria:

Keyword or phrase. Eg: find all articles containing the word 'Microsoft'.
Date published. Eg: find all articles published yesterday.
Source domain name. Eg: find all articles published on thenextweb.com.
Language. Eg: find all articles written in English.
You can sort the results in the following orders:

Date published
Relevancy to search keyword
Popularity of source
You need an API key to use the API - this is a unique key that identifies your requests. They're free while you're in development.

Authentication
Authentication is handled with a simple API key.

They're free while you are in development, and you can get one here:

Get API key

You can attach your API key to a request in one of three ways:

Via the apiKey querystring parameter.
Via the X-Api-Key HTTP header.
Via the Authorization HTTP header. Including Bearer is optional, and be sure not to base 64 encode it like you may have seen in other authentication tutorials.
We strongly recommend the either of last two so that your API key isn't visible to others in logs or via request sniffing.

If you don't append your API key correctly, or your API key is invalid, you will receive a 401 - Unauthorized HTTP error.

Via querystring
GET https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=keyword&apiKey=API_KEY
Via X-Api-Key HTTP header
X-Api-Key: API_KEY
Via Authorization HTTP header
Authorization: API_KEY

Endpoints
News API has 2 main endpoints:

Everything /v2/everything – search every article published by over 150,000 different sources large and small in the last 5 years. This endpoint is ideal for news analysis and article discovery.
Top headlines /v2/top-headlines – returns breaking news headlines for countries, categories, and singular publishers. This is perfect for use with news tickers or anywhere you want to use live up-to-date news headlines.
There is also a minor endpoint that can be used to retrieve a small subset of the publishers we can scan:

Sources /v2/top-headlines/sources – returns information (including name, description, and category) about the most notable sources available for obtaining top headlines from. This list could be piped directly through to your users when showing them some of the options available.


Everything /v2/everything
Search through millions of articles from over 150,000 large and small news sources and blogs.

This endpoint suits article discovery and analysis.

Request parameters
apiKey

q
Keywords or phrases to search for in the article title and body.

Advanced search is supported here:

Surround phrases with quotes (") for exact match.
Prepend words or phrases that must appear with a + symbol. Eg: +bitcoin
Prepend words that must not appear with a - symbol. Eg: -bitcoin
Alternatively you can use the AND / OR / NOT keywords, and optionally group these with parenthesis. Eg: crypto AND (ethereum OR litecoin) NOT bitcoin.
The complete value for q must be URL-encoded. Max length: 500 chars.

searchIn
The fields to restrict your q search to.

The possible options are:

title
description
content
Multiple options can be specified by separating them with a comma, for example: title,content.
